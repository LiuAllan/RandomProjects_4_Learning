				<h4>Hey there,</h4>
				<h1>I'm Allan Liu</h1>
				<h3>Junior Full Stack Web <u>Developer</u> | UI/UX <u>Developer</u></h3>
				<br />
				<p>I started my journey in the world of computers at very young age. As I grew older, technology has continued to grow along with me.
				During my Computer Science Degree at University of Victoria, I have learned how to solve large and complex problems alone and in teams, effectively pace and manage time, as well as best modern software practices.
				Web development is my center of interest and I wish to pursue a career as a Full Stack Web Developer. I find it fascinating how different UI and UX designs impacts the way a user interacts with a particular software or computer.
				By using web technology like JavaScript, enables me to create interactive UI components that are intuitive to all age groups.
