# READ ME

I like to learn by doing. 

This repository contains all the random projects that I decide to do and learn. It is also so that I don't have 10 million random repositories on my profile.

It will vary to all types of languages from creating front-end stuff like websites and mobile apps to data visualizations, desktop applications, bash scripts, and maybe even some machine learning!

Feel free to have a look at them, I try to write comments while I am learning so you can see my thought process and how everything works.

ps. I assure you that everything at least compiles ðŸ˜œ
